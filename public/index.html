    <p>Goodbye...my Sarah Jane! There was a war. A Time War. The Last Great Time War. My people fought a race called the Daleks, for the sake of all creation. And they lost. We lost. Everyone lost. They're all gone now. My family. My friends. Even that sky. Please, when Torchwood comes to write my complete history, don't tell people I travelled through time and space with her mother! It is! It's the city of New New York! Strictly speaking, it's the fifteenth New York since the original, so that makes it New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New New York.</p>

    <p>Goodbye...my Sarah Jane! Allons-y! Aw, I wanted to be ginger! I've never been ginger! And you, Rose Tyler! Fat lot of good you were! You gave up on me! Ooh, that's rude. Is that the sort of man I am now? Am I rude? Rude and not ginger. You need to get yourself a better dictionary. When you do, look up 'genocide'. You'll find a little picture of me there, and the caption'll read 'Over my dead body'. Don't you think she looks tired? Blimey, trying to make an Ood laugh... There's something else I've always wanted to say: Allons-y, Alonso!

    <p>People assume that time is a strict progression of cause-and-effect... but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly... timey-wimey... stuff. There's something else I've always wanted to say: Allons-y, Alonso! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Allons-y! Black tie...Whenever I wear this, something bad always happens. I'm Dr. James McCrimmon from the township of Balamory. I don't want to go. Yeah? Well I'm the Lord of Time. You can spend the rest of your life with me, but I can't spend the rest of mine with you. I have to live on. Alone. That's the curse of the Time Lords.

    <p>Allons-y! Don't you think she looks tired? What? What?! WHAT?! Please, when Torchwood comes to write my complete history, don't tell people I travelled through time and space with her mother! New-new-Doctor. There was a war. A Time War. The Last Great Time War. My people fought a race called the Daleks, for the sake of all creation. And they lost. We lost. Everyone lost.

I'll tell you what, then: don't...step on any butterflies. What have butterflies ever done to you? Black tie...Whenever I wear this, something bad always happens. Oh, yes. Harmless is just the word: that's why I like it! Doesn't kill, doesn't wound, doesn't maim. But I'll tell you what it does do: it is very good at opening doors! River, you know my name. You whispered my name in my ear! There's only one reason I would ever tell anyone my name. There's only one time I could...
